## Why Knowledge Graphs Are Catching On

That’s where knowledge graphs come in. Unlike vectors, graphs give you explicit relationships between entities. A product has a supplier. A supplier serves a location. A warehouse stores certain categories. And once that structure exists, querying becomes way more powerful and intuitive.

Here’s what makes knowledge graphs so useful in AI-powered apps:

- **Structured retrieval**: You can write precise queries instead of relying on fuzzy matches.
- **Explainability**: You can show exactly why a result was retrieved.
- **Domain alignment**: Graphs reflect real-world relationships, just like your business rules do.
